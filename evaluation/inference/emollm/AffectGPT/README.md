## ✨ OV-MER

**OV-MER** transitions from *traditional MER* to a framework that enables the prediction of *any number and category of emotions*, thereby advancing emotion AI toward real-world applicability by capturing the full spectrum of human emotions.

**(a) Task Comparison**: We compare the differences among three tasks (one-hot MER, multi-label MER, and OV-MER) across three aspects (label space, label number, and annotation manner).

**(b) Label Comparison**: We provide an example to visualize the one-hot and OV labels.

## 🚀 AffectGPT
We provide specifically designed framework, AffectGPT, for the OV-MER task.

## ✨ EmoPrefer
We propose **EmoPrefer**, a pioneering work exploring the potential of LLMs in decoding human emotion preferences. Specifically, we construct the first emotion preference dataset, **EmoPrefer-Data**, featuring high-quality preference annotations from experts. Additionally, we introduce **EmoPrefer-Bench**, which evaluates the performance of various MLLMs and prompting techniques in preference prediction, while also revealing new strategies to enhance their performance.
